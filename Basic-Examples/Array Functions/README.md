# NOTES
## Array missing element
- The `array_missing_element` takes two arrays as arguments and returns the first item in an array which does not appear in the other list. i.e the first item in list x that does not appear in the sub list - y.
- For example: the list of elements (full_list) is [1,2,3,4,5] and the sub-list (sub_list) is [1,2,5]. The returned value for `__array_missing_element(sub_list,full_list)` will be: 3.
## Sequence array
Returns a list containing all the natural numbers to the number in the argument. e.g `N=8`, so `__sequence_array(N)` will return `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`
