# Notes
When using CSV, it will affect only the execution of the whole suite, but not the single flow when it is executed from loadmill's editor.
> i.e running the flow in 'try now' (from the editor) using a CSV, will take only one random line's parameters.

**Optional**: Select a column to create a detailed description of the iteration with the selected column values.
